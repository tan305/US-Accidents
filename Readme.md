## Problem Statement
 
**On an average around 37 thousand people die of road accidents in US and reducing road accidents is an important public safety challenge. Accidents can be reduced by identifying accident hotspot locations. Occurrence of accidents can be predicted based on the weather conditions, temperature, location, weekday etc. Using our analysis, we plan to find out the most important factors that cause accident. Highway assistance for casualties is a major task during accidents, which can be improved by casualty analysis. Another important outcome during any road accident is severity of traffic which depends on the severity of accidents. So, using the dataset we have decided to predict the severity of the accidents.**

## Dataset 
 
**The dataset is car accidents data for USA with data collected from Feb 2016 to December 2019. The dataset is taken from Kaggle (US car Accidents Feb16 Dec19). It has 2.9 million observations and 49 attributes with both numerical and categorical data. The dataset is for 49 contiguous US states collected through multiple API including 2 APIs which stream real time traffic data. The features can be categorized into geographical features, weather, date-time, POI (point of interest) annotation.  Proposed techniques and data science methodology**
 
**The methodology planned to be followed to solve the problem consists of different stages. The stages include Business Understanding, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Data Modeling, Model Evaluation, Recommendations and Insights. Business understanding and data preprocessing tasks comprise of data cleaning, imputation of null values using mean/median, transforming data into meaningful variables or combination of variables. Feature engineering to select the most important features in the dataset. Data modeling includes splitting data into train and validation, running different algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost and tuning hyperparameters to build best model. Model evaluation using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC/ROC curve to select the best model. Recommendations and insights derived from exploratory analysis and models built to be implemented to solve business problems.** 
 
 
## Business Questions intended to be analyzed 
 
**We can help the government and transport department by providing insights from our analysis to devise strategies for reducing the number of accidents.**
<br>
<br>Which State and City recorded the maximum number of accidents? 
<br>Which month or year had how many accidents and if there is a trend or a pattern? 
<br>Relationship of environmental factors like weather contributing to the accident. 
<br>Relationship of accident severity with the place it occurred for Ex: traffic signal or a junction. 
<br>Which time of the day has most accidents? 
<br>Which week of the year has most accidents?
